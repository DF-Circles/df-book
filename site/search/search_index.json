Projects that have a brilliant idea, that are under time pressure and may benefit from a less public approach. </p> <p>\u2018Open ended RFPs\u2019 (Name TBD)</p> <p>There is the idea of having a kind of lightweight RFP, that has a (yearly?) budget, but no specific deadlines. A dedicated committee will review the incoming proposals regularly, and whenever there is a proposal that stands out and is expected to bring exceptional value, we can award it with some budget. This will offer a kind of \u2018fast route\u2019 for brilliant projects that require speed and perhaps less public visibility while in development. The details regarding budget sources, and the make up of this committee etc. are to be determined. Example topics for \u2018Open ended RFPs\u2019 can be: </p> <ul> <li> <p>OpenCog Hyperon-related projects (Open challenge, very few specific requirements)</p> </li> <li> <p>Projects that use or create knowledge nodes on the platform </p> </li> <li> <p>Regional Townhalls (will have more conditions, and open for specific regions until filled)</p> </li> <li> <p>Marketing proposals ( general conditions but will be strictly evaluated against added value, measurability etc.) </p> </li> </ul> <p>Funding decision tree</p> <p>To clarify all (future) funding options and their target audiences, we created this funding decision tree:</p> <p>https://singularitynet.atlassian.net/wiki/x/HYAXI </p> <p> see a larger version on https://singularitynet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DF/pages/538411037</p>"},{"location":"about/pillars/pillar-3/","title":"Pillar 3 - Developer outreach","text":"<p>This is in an early development stage. Originally the idea was to have a third staff member next to Jan and Raphael. However, some community members rose to the occasion and requested to build this up grass-roots way. We have now a defacto \u2018Developer Outreach Circle\u2019 that is working on some experiments around Hackathons. There may also turn out to be some overlap with the \u2018Events Circle\u2019 that is in charge of (regional, central) Town halls and similar events.
